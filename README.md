dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X. This repo includes my minimalistically customized dwm configuration.

## Requirements

In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


## Installation

1. Clone the repo:
```git clone https://github.com/braticpetar/dwm.git```

2. Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

3. Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):
```make clean install```

4. **Run it**
